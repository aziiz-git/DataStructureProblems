1. ArrayList:
- List<Integer> myList = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(myArray));
- myArray = myList.toArray(myArray); --> List to Array conversion and store in same array
- 


2. Array:
- Integer[] myArray = { 9, 6, 4, 90, 34 }; | int myArray[] = { 9, 6, 4, 90, 34 }; | 
- Arrays.toString(myArray)
- Arrays.asList(myArray) --> To get as ArrayList


3. final:
- This is a keyword.
- To declare a variable whose value cannot be changed.
- To prevent inheritance.
- To prevent method overriding  (Declare a method as final in Parent Class and then, in the Child class, a method with the same name not possible.)


4. finally:
- This is a block

5. finalize:
- This is a method.
